# Nixify your haskell project

<!-- This is the first part of the series that will help you improve the dev workflow of your haskell project in every part.  -->
This is the first part of a series of blogs, with the end-goal of having a better dev workflow for your haskell project. We are aiming for a "works out-of-the-box" experience. [Nix](https://nixos.org) will be used during this process. [Read here](https://haskell.flake.page/nix-rapid) for a rapid introduction to Nix. Throughout this series we assume the reader to have an understanding of Nix and [Nix flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes).\

The series is designed in a way that each blog will work on the previous blog to improve the development experience. First blog will introduce you to the pain points of using a haskell project without Nix, then we will bring in Nix flakes. The Haskell project of choice here is, [todo-app](https://github.com/juspay/todo-app). This app was chosen for two main reasonse: 1) Keep it simple 2)
